# InteractingMoranEffects

#Proposed title: How environmental causes of synchrony interact


#DAN: make sure the tests run - I copied them from diverse locations, so they may crash just because they
#try to source files from the wrong places

#DAN: make sure everything that needs testing has a tests_ file
#Note: to run all tsts in the directory, set the working directory to the Code directory and type testthat::test_dir(".")

#DAN: see notes in Approach_ModellingSpectra_General for other things that need to be done

#DAN: By the way, you ought to change the file name of Approach_ModellingSpectra_General to something that fits
#better in this repo structure
